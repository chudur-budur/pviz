  abstract = {This paper deals with the issue of generating one Pareto optimal point that is guaranteed to be in a ``desirable'' part of the Pareto set in a given multicriteria optimization problem. A parameterization of the Pareto set based on the recently developed normal-boundary intersection technique is used to formulate a subproblem, the solution of which yields the point of ``maximum bulge'', often referred to as the ``knee of the Pareto curve''. This enables the identification of the ``good region'' of the Pareto set by solving one nonlinear programming problem, thereby bypassing the need to generate many Pareto points. Further, this representation extends the concept of the ``knee'' for problems with more than two objectives. It is further proved that this knee is invariant with respect to the scales of the multiple objective functions.},

  abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

  abstract = {Techniques for multidimensional scaling visualize objects as points in a low-dimensional metric map. As a result, the visualizations are subject to the fundamental limitations of metric spaces. These limitations prevent multidimensional scaling from faithfully representing non-metric similarity data such as word associations or event co-occurrences. In particular, multidimensional scaling cannot faithfully represent intransitive pairwise similarities in a visualization, and it cannot faithfully visualize ``central'' objects. In this paper, we present an extension of a recently proposed multidimensional scaling technique called t-SNE. The extension aims to address the problems of traditional multidimensional scaling techniques when these techniques are used to visualize non-metric similarities. The new technique, called multiple maps t-SNE, alleviates these problems by constructing a collection of maps that reveal complementary structure in the similarity data. We apply multiple maps t-SNE to a large data set of word association data and to a data set of NIPS co-authorships, demonstrating its ability to successfully visualize non-metric similarities.},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs{\textemdash}30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers{\textemdash}a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

  abstract  = { Multiobjective optimization is a powerful tool for resolving conflicting objectives in engineering design and numerous other fields. One general approach to solving multiobjective optimization problems involves generating a set of Pareto optimal solutions, followed by selecting the most attractive solution from this set as the final design. The success of this approach critically depends on the designer's ability to obtain, manage, and interpret the Pareto set—importantly, the size and distribution of the Pareto set. The potentially significant difficulties associated with comparing a significantly large number of Pareto designs can be circumvented when the Pareto set: (i) is adequately small, (ii) represents the complete Pareto frontier, (iii) emphasizes the regions of the Pareto frontier that entail significant tradeoff, and (iv) de-emphasizes the regions corresponding to little tradeoff. We call a Pareto set that possesses these four important and desirable properties a smart Pareto set. Specifically, a smart Pareto set is one that is small and effectively represents the tradeoff properties of the complete Pareto frontier. This article presents a general method to obtain smart Pareto sets for problems of n objectives, given previously generated sets of Pareto solutions. Under the proposed method, the designer uses a smart Pareto filter to control the size of the Pareto set and the degree of tradeoff representation among objectives. Importantly, the smart Pareto filter yields a Pareto set comprising a minimal number of solutions needed to adequately characterize the problem's tradeoff properties. In this article, the smart Pareto filter is analytically developed, and mathematical and physical examples are presented to illustrate the filter's effectiveness. },

  abstract  = {In Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (EMO), the mechanism of -dominance has received significant attention because of its ability to guarantee convergence near the Pareto frontier and maintain diversity among solutions at a reasonable computational cost. A noticeable weakness of this mechanism is its inability to vary the resolution it provides of the Pareto frontier based on the frontier's tradeoff properties. We therefore propose a new mechanism---L-dominance, based on the Lam{\'e} curve---as an alternative to -dominance in EMO. The geometry of the Lam{\'e} curve naturally supports a greater concentration of Pareto solutions in regions of significant tradeoff between objectives. This variable resolution of solutions allows an algorithm using L-dominance to generate fewer solutions to describe the Pareto frontier as a whole while maintaining a desired concentration of solutions where the frontier requires greater detail. The L-dominance mechanism is analyzed theoretically and by simulation on five test problems, and is shown to result in increasingly significant computational gains as the dimensionality of problems increases.},
